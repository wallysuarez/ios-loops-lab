for j in stride(from: 7, to: 40, by: 10) {
print(j)
}
}
```

***

`Numbers that are divisible by 3`
```
for i in 20...150 where i % 3 == 0 {

}

```

}
}
```

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`
```
for i in 20...150 {
if i == 31 || i == 35 ||
(i >= 40 && i <= 60 ) {
print(i)
}
}
```
***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```

The program will enter into an endless loop because there is no stopping condition or break written into the code.


***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

repeat {
(i > 3)
i += 1
} while (i <= 9)
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

repeat {
(i > 3)
i += 1
} while (i < 1005)

```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

repeat {
(i > 3)
i += 1
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)
}
} while (i < 1005)

```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
They will produce different outputs because Repeat-while loops test the termination condition at the end of the loop, rather than the start.  This means that the second while-loop will run twice, and the first while-loop will only run once.

***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.


The `break` statement stops the execution of a loop. After the loop is stopped the program goes on to the next statement outside the loop.

The `continue` statement  tells the loop to stop at a certain iteration and start again at the beginning of the next iteration throught the loop.


***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[x]1
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[x]8
[x]9
[x]10

***
## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[x]1
[x]2
[x]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2 {
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```

The continue statement interrupts the number of iterations the inner loop would otherwise run.
Instead of running 3 times, the inner loop only runs one iteration. As soon as y=2, the loop continue statement commands the program to return back to the outer loop.
The program prints x = 1, x = 2, x = 3, and y = 1, y = 1, y = 1 


***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

```
let x = 0...10
let y = 0...10

for i in x {
for j in y {
print("\(i), \(j)", terminator: " ")
}
print()
}
```
***
## Question 21

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

```
let x = 0...10
let y = 0...10

for i in x {
for j in y where i - j >= 5 {
print("(\(i), \(j))", terminator: " ")
}
}
```
***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
